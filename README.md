# Warning !!

**I'm not responsible if the Livolo manufacturer change the board hardware revision or if you bought the wrong product !**

# Why i'm working with this switch ?

## Run without neutral wire (2 wires system) :

I leave in France and we are only 2 wires for the light switch. 

For the moment, there is no mysensors project for 2 wires installation.

The Linovo EU switch is a 2 wires project !!


## No need more place in your wall :

Who has never been a lack of a place in his wall box ?

This product can be installed in your existing wall box in place of your interruptor without a problem !!

## Touch Pad and beautifull design :

Maybe it's the future ? 

So you'll have an ultimate beauty and you'll be able to command your light with a sensitive touch control feeling like iPhone touch.

## Seems pretty  safe :

I don't know for you, but i am pretty scared about fire with electronic in my walls. 

That's why i don't want to put any electronical card in my walls without case and this switch has a one.
